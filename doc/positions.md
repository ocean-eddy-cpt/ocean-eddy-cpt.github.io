# Positions

Multiple postdoctoral research positions are available as part of a
multi-institution Climate Process Team (CPT) on Ocean Transport and Eddy
Energy. The CPT aims to survey, improve, and unify new advances in energy-,
flow-, and scale-aware parameterizations of mesoscale eddies, in process
studies and global ocean models; constrain parameters and parameterized fluxes
through a synthesis of up-to-date observations of ocean energetics and
transport; and implement and assess schemes within IPCC-class climate models at
NCAR, NOAA-GFDL, and DOE-LANL. The expectation is that modernized,
energetically-consistent mesoscale eddy parameterizations will significantly
reduce climate model biases in ocean currents, stratification, and transport.

## Open positions

- Princeton University (Supervised by Alistair Adcroft, <mailto:aadcroft@princeton.edu>): Implementation and
  assessment of extant parameterizations of mesoscale eddies in process,
  idealized and global ocean models; consistent and optimized formulation of
  closures; development and assessment of improved and unified closures;
  evaluation of new closures in climate models.
  More information and application at <https://puwebp.princeton.edu/AcadHire/apply/application.xhtml?listingId=18962>.

Applications must include a cover letter, a CV with a list of publications, a
statement of research interests, and contact information of 3 references.
Applicants wishing to be considered for positions in multiple institutions
should indicate this in their cover letter, and submit a separate application
to each position of interest. For more information email Laure Zanna
(<mailto:laure.zanna@nyu.edu>), or any of the collaborating PIs listed above.
