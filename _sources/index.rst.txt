Ocean Transport and Eddy Energy CPT
===================================


Welcome the Ocean Transport and Eddy Energy Climate Process Team.
This CPT is a large collaborative project funded by NOAA and NSF.

CPT Goals
---------

Energy entering the climate system in the form of solar radiation is
transferred between a variety of forms, scales, and locations before eventual
radiation back into space.  Most of the ocean’s kinetic energy takes the form
of mesoscale eddies, which have lateral scales from tens to hundreds of
kilometers and have a significant impact on the transport of heat, freshwater,
carbon, nutrients, and biota throughout the oceans.
These eddies are partially resolved in many climate models, and  much of their
momentum and tracer transports are parametrized.  Imperfections in these
parametrizations lead to prominent biases in the climate models, including
incorrect rates of exchange of heat and carbon with the atmosphere, errors in
the position and strength of some of the ocean’s strongest current systems, and
incorrect stratification at high latitudes, inter alia.
Extant parametrizations fail to make a complete accounting for the energetics
of mesoscale eddies: exchanges of mesoscale energy with the resolved large
scales and with submesoscales, conversions between eddy kinetic and potential
energies, and transport of eddy energy across ocean basins.

**This Climate Process Team (CPT) aims to implement, assess, improve, and unify
recent work on energetically-consistent ocean eddy momentum and tracer
parametrizations in ocean-only and coupled climate models to improve model
fidelity.**
We will implement and compare recently-developed energetically-consistent
parametrizations in the NCAR, GFDL, and LANL climate
models.
